The ODatabase class provides the main APIs an application uses. ODatabase communicates with a OStorage class implementation that stores physically the records.

There are three OStorage implementations:
 * *Local*: reads and writes records on the local file system
 * *Remote*: acts as a proxy that sends and receives all the requests to a remote Orient DB Server instance
 * *Memory*: keeps all records in memory
