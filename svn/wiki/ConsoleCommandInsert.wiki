= Insert =

Insert a new record into the current database. Remember that Orient can work also in schema-less mode, so you can create any field at-the-fly.

== Syntax ==

{{{insert into <class|cluster:<cluster>> (<field-name>*) values ( <field-value> )}}}

== Example ==

nsert a new record with name 'Jay' and surname 'Miner':

{{{
> insert into Profile (name, surname) values ('Jay', 'Miner' )

Inserted record in 0,060000 sec(s).
}}}


Insert a new record adding a relationship:

{{{
insert into Employee (name, boss) values ('jack', 11:99 )
}}}

Insert a new record adding a collection of relationship:

{{{
insert into Profile (name, friends) values ('Luca', [10:3, 10:4] )
}}}
