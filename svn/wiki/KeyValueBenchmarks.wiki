= Introduction =

Hey, I know. These are <b>micro benchmarks</b> and can't be taken as unique meter to compare products. However it's an index of the speed of the engine. Take it for what it is!

= Scenario =

These benchmarks are made using [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html Apache Ab utility] in bundle with the distribution of Orient under the "benchmarks" folder.

1 DELL Notebook model XPS M1530 with Intel(r) Core Duo T7700 2.40Ghz, 3 GB RAM and HD 5.400rpm, O.S. MS Windows Vista, JDK 1.6

= Summary of the results =

|| *Test type* || *Total requests* || *Concurrent clients/threads* || *Configuration* || *Total time elapsed* (less is better) || *Requests per second* (more is better) || *Version* ||
|| HTTP GET on /petshop/demo/key-1 || 100,000 || 1 || Local Database || 7.98 seconds || 9,954 ||0.9.8 ||
|| HTTP GET on /petshop/demo/key-1 || 100,000 || 2 || Local Database || 10.04 seconds || 12,521 ||0.9.8 ||
|| HTTP GET on /petshop/demo/key-1 || 100,000 || 10 || Local Database || 8.58 seconds || 11,652 ||0.9.8 ||
|| HTTP GET on /petshop/demo/key-1 || 100,000 || 50 || Local Database || 10.29 seconds || 9,709 ||0.9.8 ||
|| HTTP GET on /petshop/demo/key-1 || 100,000 || 100 || Local Database || 10.67 seconds || 9,370 ||0.9.8 ||
|| HTTP GET on /petshop/demo/key-1 || 100,000 || 100 || Partitioned Database (1 node) || 5.99 seconds || 16,677 ||0.9.8 ||

As you can see:
 * Orient Key/Value Server uses *both the processors* of the host machine hitting the record with 2 clients. The *multi-threading architecture* works well since multiple clients outperforms the serial requests (client=1).
 * Even if the concurrent connections *growth up 50 times*, the loose of performance is minimum.

= Detail of the tests =

== HTTP GET 100.000 times, executed by 10 concurrent threads.
