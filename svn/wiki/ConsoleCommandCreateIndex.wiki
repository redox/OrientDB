= Create Index =

The *SQL Create Index* command creates an index on a property defined in the schema. 

Indexes can be:
 * *unique*, doesn't allow duplicated
 * *not unique*, allows duplicates
 * *full-text*, by indexing any single word of the text. It's used in query with the operator [SQLWhere#Operators CONTAINSTEXT]

== Syntax == 
{{{
CREATE INDEX <name> [ON <class-name> (prop-names)] <type> [<key-type>]
}}}
Where:

 * *name* logical name of index. Can be *{{{<class>.<property>}}}* to create an automatic index bound to a schema property. In this case *class* is the class of the schema and *property*, is the property created into the class. Notice that in another case index name can't contain '.' symbol
 * *class-name* name of class that automatic index created for. Class with such name must already exist in database
 * *prop-names* comma-separated list of properties that this automatic index is created for. Property with such name must already exist in schema
 * *type*, between 'unique', 'notunique' and 'fulltext'
 * *key-type*, is the type of key (Optional). On automatic indexes is auto-determined by reading the target schema property where the index is created. If not specified for manual indexes, at run-time during the first insertion the type will be auto determined by reading the type of the class.
