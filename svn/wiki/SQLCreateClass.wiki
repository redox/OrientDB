#summary SQL command: CREATE CLASS

= Create Class =

The *SQL Create Class* command creates a new class in the schema. _NOTE: If a cluster with the same name exists in the database will be used as default cluster._

== Syntax ==

Where:
 * *class* is the class to create
 * *super-class*, optional, is the super-class to extend
 * *clusterId* can be a list separated by comma (,). At least one element is mandatory and it's also the default cluster id

== Examples ==

Create the class 'Account':

{{{CREATE CLASS Account}}}

Create the class 'Car' that extends 'Vehicle':

{{{CREATE CLASS Car extends Vehicle}}}

Create the class 'Car' with clusterId 10:

{{{CREATE CLASS Car CLUSTER 10}}}

To remove a class use the [SQLRemoveClass Drop Class] command.
