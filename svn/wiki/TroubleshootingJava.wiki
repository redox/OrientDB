== Database instance has been released to the pool. Get another database instance from the pool with the right username and password ==

This is a generic error telling that the database has been found closed while using it. 

Check the stack trace to find the reason of it:

== OLazyObjectIterator ==
This is the case when you're working with [ObjectDatabase Object Database API] and a field contains a collection or a map loaded in lazy. On iteration it needs an open database to fetch linked records.

Solutions:
 * assure to leave the database open while browsing the field
 * or early load all the instances (just iterate the items)
 * define a fetch-plan to load the entire object tree in one shoot and then work offline. If you need to save the object back to the database then reopen the database and call {{{db.save( object )}}}.

== Stack Overflow on saving objects ==
This could be due to the high deep of the graph, usually when you create many records. To fix it save the records more often.
