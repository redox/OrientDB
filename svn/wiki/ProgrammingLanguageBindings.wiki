= Language bindings =

We've 3 kinds of drivers:
 * *Native binary remote*, that talks directly against the TCP/IP socket using the binary protocol specified in http://code.google.com/p/orient/wiki/NetworkBinaryProtocol
 * *HTTP REST/JSON*, that talks directly against the TCP/IP socket using the HTTP protocol specified in http://code.google.com/p/orient/wiki/OrientDB_REST
 * *Java wrapped*, as a layer that links in some way the native Java driver. This is pretty easy for languages that run into the JVM like Scala, Groovy and JRuby

This is the list of the known drivers to use OrientDB through different languages:

 * *JAVA*
  * [JavaAPI Java (native) API]
 * *Javascript*
  * [JavascriptAPI Javascript Driver] HTTP protocol
 * *Scala*
  * Scala runs on top of JVM and it's fully compatible with Java applications like OrientDB. [ScalaLanguage Scala page] offers suggestions and examples to use it without pains
  * [https://github.com/eptx/OrientDBScala Scala utilities and tests] to help Scala developers using OrientDB
 * *C* Language binding
  * [https://github.com/dam2k/liborient LibOrient] Binary protocol compatibles with C++ and other languages that supports C calls
  * [http://github.com/tglman/orientdb-c OrientDB-C] Another project in development as binary protocol
 * *PHP*
  * [https://github.com/AntonTerekhov/OrientDB-PHP OrientDB-PHP] binary protocol
  * [https://github.com/congow/Orient Orient CONGOW] High level framework to use OrientDB from PHP
 * *Ruby*
  * [https://github.com/aemadrid/orientdb-jruby OrientDB-JRuby] through Java driver,
  * Ruby, soon public available

 * *.NET*
  * [DotNET .NET Native driver] ported from the Java API using [http://www.ikvm.net IKVM tool]
  * [http://netorientdb.codeplex.com/ .NET HTTP protocol]

 * *Python*
  * [http://bulbflow.com Bulbflow project] uses [https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/wiki Rexter] Graph HTTP Server to access to OrientDB database. [https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/wiki/Rexster-Configuration Configure Rexster for OrientDB]
  * [https://github.com/emehrkay/Compass Python] HTTP protocol

= Standard supported =

This is the list of the library to use OrientDB by using such standard:

 * *[https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki TinkerPop Blueprints]*, the standard for Graph Databases. OrientDB is 100% compliant with latest version
 * *[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-jsp-135919.html JDO 2.2]* and *[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javaee/jpa-137156.html JPA 2]* by using the *[http://www.datanucleus.org Data Nucleus]* adapter: https://github.com/luigidellaquila/datanucleus-store-orientdb/
