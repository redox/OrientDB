== Java Runtime Environment ==
OrientDB requires Java SE 6 to be installed in order to deploy the Server component. Client applications can be written using Java SE 5.

You can check which version of Java SE you have installed by typing "java -version" in a command shell (or a command prompt for Windows users):
{{{

You can now open the demo database shipped with the OrientDB distribution by using the [ConsoleCommandConnect connect] command:
{{{connect local:../databases/demo/demo admin admin}}}
This will open the database located "locally" in your file system using the administrator account. For more information about the databases and the proper formats of URLs go [Concepts#Database here]. The output of the previous command should be the following:
{{{
> connect local:../databases/demo/demo admin admin
Connecting to database [local:../databases/demo/demo]...OK
}}}
Once connected, you may view the information about the database by typing [ConsoleCommandInfo info] command:
{{{
> info
Current database: ../databases/demo/demo
