= Transaction mode =
By default Blueprints API works with the Transaction mode setted to AUTOMATIC that means every single operation begins and commits a transaction. This could be VERY expensive and unnecessary. By setting the property *blueprints.graph.txMode* to 1 the default Transaction mode is MANUAL: every single operation will be stored immediately to the disk avoiding the more expensive Transaction context. Example:
{{{
java ... -Dblueprints.graph.txMode=1 ...
}}}

or

{{{
OGlobalConfiguration.BLUEPRINTS_TX_MODE.setValue(1);
}}}
