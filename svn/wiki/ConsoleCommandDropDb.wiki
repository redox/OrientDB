= Drop Database =

The *Drop Database* command definitely deletes a database. If a database is open and no database name is used, then the current database will be deleted. _NOTE: Unless you've made backups there is no way to restore a deleted database._

== Syntax ==

For database opened using "local" protocol:
{{{
DROP DATABASE
}}}

To remove a database hosted in a remote OrientDB Server you need the credential to do it at the target OrientDB server:

{{{
DROP DATABASE <database-name> <server-username> <server-userpassword>
}}}

Where:
 * *database-name* is the name of database. If not specified means the current database if it's opened
 * *server-username* is the name of the server's user with privileges to drop the database
 * *server-userpassword* is the password of the server's user

== Examples ==

Delete the current local database:

{{{
DROP DATABASE
}}}

Delete the remote database "demo" hosted on localhost:

{{{
DROP DATABASE remote:localhost/demo root 5B1A917B20C78ECAA219E37CFDDA6598D4D62CE68DD82E5B05D4949758A66828
}}}

To create a new database use the [ConsoleCommandCreateDb Create Database] command.
