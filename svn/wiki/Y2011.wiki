#summary Greetings from OrientDB world-wide team

This page is to provide a more "human" face to the software development behind OrientDB. The idea born after a nice email received from the Exigen team.

The next year, 2012, seems to be THE year for Graph Databases. I bet on OrientDB. In the meanwhile happy holidays and new year!

2011 has been a great year for OrientDB: a heap of releases, new features and so many bugs fixed. The next official 1.0 is really close.

Thanks a lot to the entire world-wide team and happy new year!

I'm the Grammar and Spelling Nazi hoping to ensure that the documentation is unambiguous. No picture (yet) because I'm vain and don't have one that I'd be happy to publicise.

Auguri per l'Anno Nuovo, spero che porta ai tutti gli utenti di OrientDb tranquilità e prosperità. Best wishes for the New Year. I hope it brings peace and prosperity to all OrientDb users.

% "The cat's mother" is a difficult-to-translate English expression that carries a sense that the person being referred to is not very important to the speaker (in this case the cats).

Best wishes for a happy New Year's starting and a wonderful 2012!!!
